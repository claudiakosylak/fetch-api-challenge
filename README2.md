# Receipt Processor
I have built a webservice with Express.js that fulfills the documented API requirements for this challenge.

## Getting started

### Install Node.js and npm
If you don't have node.js and npm installed already, you will have to follow the below instructions according to your operating system to install them.

#### Install Node.js and npm on Windows
1. Download the Windows installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download, the Node.js official website, making sure you are downloading the most recent version of Node.js.

2. Open the downloaded installation file, giving access to run the application. In the installation wizard, click next and choose your desired path for installing Node.js. Click next again to get to the custom setup page. Make sure to select "npm package manager" instead of the default "Node.js runtime" in order to install npm and node.js simultaneously. Click next again and then finally click Install.

3. Confirm you have successfully installed node and npm by typing `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If successfully installed, you will see the respective version numbers.

#### Install Node.js and npm on Mac
1. Install Homebrew. If you don't already have Homebrew installed on your machine, follow the instructions to install Homebrew on their site at https://brew.sh/

2. Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        brew install node

3. Confirm you have successfully installed node and npm by typing `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If successfully installed, you will see the respective version numbers.

### Install dependencies

Once you have Node.js and npm successfully installed, run the following command from the root of the project directory to install necessary dependencies:

        npm install

### Start the application

Once dependencies are finished installing, run the following command from the root of the project directory to start the application:

        npm start

## API Documentation

### Process Receipts

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Example body:

    ```json
    {
        "retailer": "Walgreens",
        "purchaseDate": "2022-01-02",
        "purchaseTime": "08:13",
        "total": "2.65",
        "items": [
            {"shortDescription": "Pepsi - 12-oz", "price": "1.25"},
            {"shortDescription": "Dasani", "price": "1.40"}
        ]
    }
    ```
* Successful Response
    * Status code: 200
    * Body: JSON containing an id for the processed receipt.
    * Example body:

    ```json
    { "id": "1" }
    ```

* Error Response: Invalid receipt
    * Status code: 400
    * Response:
    ```json
    { "Error": "The receipt is invalid" }
    ```

### Get Points

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Successful Response
    * Status code: 200
    * Body: JSON containing the number of points awarded to the receipt with the given ID
    * Example body:

    ```json
    { "points": 32 }
    ```
* Error response: No receipt for given ID
    * Status code: 404
    * Response:

    ```json
    { "Error": "No receipt found for that id" }
    ```
